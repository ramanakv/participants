OO features
----------------

Encapsulation
	hiding the data and expose the data through methods
			declare variables as private
			declare methods as public to access the variables
			
Inheritance
	creating new classes using existing classes
	reusability
	
Polymorphism
	what we need - super class reference variable and method overriding
	when a method is called on super class reference, the method of the object it is holding is executed
	
Abstraction
    knowing what to do and not knowing how to do
	super class decides that a method is required
	this method declared as abstract in super class
	implementation of this method is the responsibility of sub classes
