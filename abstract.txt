abstract method and abstract classes
====================================

Method which is not completely defined is called abstract method
method does not have the body ( opening and closing braces)
Reason: we do not know what code will go into the method
we cannot call this method

How to create abstract methods
   abstract returntype  methodname(arguments) ;
   
class containing abstract method becomes abstract class  (need to declare it as abstract )
 
it is not possible to instantiate abstract classes  (we cannot create objects of this class)

abstract methods have to be fully implemented by subclasses, otherwise those classes also become abstract
