Object class:
=============

java provides a class whose name is Object  in java.lang package

Object is super class for all objects in java

    class Hello{ }         is coverted by the compiler to
  
      class Hello extends java.lang.Object {
	   }
	  
Methods of Object class are available in every class of java

Methods:
     notify(), wait(), notifyAll()   <-- related multithread programs
	 
	 boolean equals(Object o)    <-- used to compare objects
	 String toString()  <-- used to convert object data into a single string
	 int hashCode()   <-- generate hashCode for the object (used in collections)
	 
hashCode()
     used to generate a unique integer for an object
	 this method required when we store objects in HashSet(will come later in collections)
	 
toString()
     used to convert object data to a string
	 this method is called when we use   System.out.println(e1)
	 this method in Object simply returns classname@hashcode which is useless
	 we need to override this method to get meaningful output
	 
equals()
	used to compare data of objects
	direct comparison of objects with == compares only references.
	to compare primitives == operator is suitable as we are comparing values of primitives
	
	To compare objects, we have to use equals() method defined in Object class
	method of Object class comapres references which is not correct
	so, we need to override this method
